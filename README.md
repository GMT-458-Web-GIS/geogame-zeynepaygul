![geogame](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c51b554-4202-42fc-a663-0343c634becb)


## Game Objective
Geo-Game is an interactive "Hot-Cold" treasure hunting game designed to challenge players to find a hidden treasure on a map using proximity-based clues. The goal is to locate the treasure in as few clicks as possible.

## Requirements
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Used for developing the game interface and core game logic.
- **OpenLayers**: Map library used to manage the map component and the hidden treasure target.

## Design Elements

### 1. User Interface
- **Map Viewer**: The main game screen where the treasure is hidden at a random location on the map.
- **Clue Area**: Displays clues such as "Hot", "Warm", or "Cold" after each click to indicate proximity to the treasure.
- **Click Counter**: Tracks the number of attempts the player has made.
- **Start Button**: Initiates the game and places the treasure at a random location.

## Game Flow

1. **Hint**: Players can click on the Hint Button to get additional information about the treasure's location.
2. **Guess**: Players click anywhere on the map to search for the treasure. After each guess, they receive a clue in the Clue Area about their proximity to the treasure.
3. **Finding the Treasure**: The game ends when players find the treasure by getting close enough to its location.
